        <p>His full name is Sir Leon Thomas the Third. He is a beautiful local breed, five years old now, and was knighted back in 2022 by my highchool friends when they had the pleasure of hearing about his regalness.</p>

        <h3 id="article2-heading">WHAT DOES SIR THOMAS DO?!ðŸ‘€</h3>
        <p>Sir Thomas prefers to spend most of his time basking outside under the lovely sun as it is important for the high quality of his fur as well as his vitamin D intake. During the cold season, he seeks refuge in the study room on the warm cushioned chairs.</p>
