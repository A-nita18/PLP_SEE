              <h3 id="article1-heading">WHERE DID HE COME FROM?!üòå</h3>
              <p>Sir Leon Thomas spent most of his childhood in the Sisters of Notredame convent where he was born and raised with his siblings.
                He was the fourth of a strong litter of seven and was gracefully handed over to me in a lovely box when I went to pick him up.

            <article aria-labelledby="article2-heading">
              <h3 id="article2-heading">HOW OLD IS HE?!üëÄ</h3>
              <p>He prefers not to share his age. He is rather appalled that we dared to ask.
                "A person's value is not found in their age"

              <h3 id="article2-heading">ANY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE?!üò§</h3>
              <p>"Time is a social construct. It is a human flaw to be always caught up in either past or future. I treasure the moment, that's why I take frequent naps."
                He however, urges us to invest in the stock market as early as yesterday.</p>
